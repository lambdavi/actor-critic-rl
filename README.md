# Actor Critic Methods
Welcome to this exploratory project about Actor-Critic method! This repository contains code and resources for implementing and experimenting with actor-critic algorithms in the field of deep reinforcement learning. The environment is built using OpenAI Gym and has been tested in two different environments: CartPole and Acrobot.

The Actor Critic Methods, consist in:

- The “Critic” estimates the value function. This could be the action-value (the Q value) or state-value (the V value).<br>
- The “Actor” updates the policy distribution in the direction suggested by the Critic (such as with policy gradients).
